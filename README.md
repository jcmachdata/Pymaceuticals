## Analysis

* For the purposes of this study, three drugs (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril) and a placebo were evaluated for their effectiveness at reducing tumor size in mice. With regards to tumor size, Capomulin was the only drug that showed efficacy. Mice treated with Capomulin showed a 19.5% reduction in tumor size after 45 days. 
* Both Capomulin and Infubinol were effective and decreasing the rate of metastic spread. The sites averaged 1.48 and 2.11, respectively, while mice that were given placebo averaged 3.27.
* Capomulin was the only drug effective at increasing the survival rate of the mice. Mice that were given placebo had a survival rate of 44%, while mice who were given Capomulin had a survival rate of 84%.
* Although the "Tumor Response to Treatment" graph appears to show that Ketapril may actually increase tumor size, a t-test reveals a p-value of 0.83 indicating no significant difference from placebo.
